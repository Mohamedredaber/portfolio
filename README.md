# 🌐 Portfolio Web Application

## 📖 Description

This portfolio is a modern web application designed to showcase my personal and collaborative web development projects.

It allows users to explore each project in detail, including:
- Features and functionalities  
- Technologies used  
- Screenshots  
- Links to source code repositories  

The application is multilingual (French, English, Arabic) and provides a clean and intuitive navigation with a dedicated page for each project.

For team-based projects, a special **Team** section highlights contributors, their roles, and their contact information (GitHub, LinkedIn, email, and phone).

This portfolio was developed using **React** and **Redux** for language management, with a strong focus on user experience, modern design, and dynamic data structure.
